# Hurrah Typerr
Hurrah Typer is a powerful automation tool that transforms the way you solve coding questions and quizzes on practice platforms. With built-in LLM (Large Language Model) support, it automatically captures the question, generates accurate code or answers, and types it out in real time, just like a human would. Students, or anyone want to write code automatically without switching the tab aur desktop.
